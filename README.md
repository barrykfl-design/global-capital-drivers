# Global Capital Drivers
Global Capital Drivers - The New Great Game with AI 資本之推手 · 大國博弈分析器

🎯 Core Purpose

This AI Analytics tool decodes global capital flows and human financial behavior by bridging three critical pillars of the global economy:
Commodity Markets: Real-time prices and volatility for gold, silver, crude oil, copper, and natural gas ("The great game of nations is won by those who understand the link between geopolitics, technology, and commodities.").

Geopolitical Risk (GPR): Country-level risk scores tied to conflicts, sanctions, and political instability (the "great game of nations"). 

AI Energy Consumption Index (AECI): A proprietary index algorithm tracking global AI computing power demand ( A new developed index to improve the accuracy with GPR Algorithm).

By correlating these three dimensions, it reveals how geopolitical tensions, AI infrastructure growth, and commodity supply/demand drive trillions in cross-border capital movement—empowering you to see beyond surface-level market trends.

🔍 Key Features
1. Real-Time Commodity Tracking
Live prices (USD/oz) with 24-hour volatility charts.
Per-gram/per-unit conversions for quick comparisons.
Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds (HKT) with fallback simulation for unreliable connections.

2. Geopolitical Risk Map
Interactive world map highlighting 20+ countries with:
Critical/Medium/Low risk ratings (GPR Index).
Hover details: Conflict events, sanctions, and resource disputes.
Source attribution (World Bank, IMF, Bloomberg, Reuters).

3. AI Energy Consumption Index (AECI)
12 months of historical data (Jan 2025–Dec 2025) tracking:
Global data center power demand (GW).
AI workload growth (+145.7% in 2025).
Key events (AI related news).
Sources: Stanford AI Report, IEA, Greenpeace, OECD.

4. Commodity Correlation Engine Al
GPR ρ: How strongly a commodity reacts to geopolitical shocks.
AECI ρ: How AI computing demand impacts prices.
Leading Coefficient: Combined GPR × AECI impact (Human Financial Algorithm).

5. Capital Flow Insights
Uncovers hidden trends: you will see it after run.
